- **Technology**:  
  - **Backend**: Java (Jakarta EE) for API handling and data processing.  
  - **Frontend**: React.js for rendering and user interface.  
  - **Satellite Data**: Integration with **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Sentinel-2** datasets for high-resolution optical imagery.  
  - **Data Storage**: Use **PostgreSQL** to store metadata, satellite images, and user annotations.

### Implementation:
1. **Satellite Data Integration**:  
   - Integrate **Google Earth Engine API** to retrieve satellite images from various sources such as **Sentinel-2** and **Landsat-8**.
   - Use **Sentinel-2** for optical imagery with **10-60m resolution**. For higher resolution, integrate other sources if available.

2. **Image Processing**:  
   - Apply **image processing algorithms** to analyze vegetation, color, and structure patterns.
   - Use **OpenCV** or **GDAL** for preprocessing the satellite imagery to detect features like geometric shapes or unusual patterns indicative of human settlements.

3. **Frontend**:  
   - Use **WebGL** with **React.js** for rendering satellite images interactively.
   - Allow users to zoom, pan, and mark features directly on the map. Integrate **Leaflet.js** for handling map rendering.

## 2. **LiDAR and 3D Mapping**
### Objective:
To provide users with detailed **3D models** of terrain and hidden structures, based on **LiDAR** and **topographic data**.

### Plan:
- **Technology**:  
  - **Backend**: Java for handling 3D data storage and processing.
  - **Frontend**: React.js + **three.js** for 3D rendering.
  - **LiDAR Data**: Integration with **LiDAR data from NASA or commercial providers**.
  - **Storage**: Use **PostgreSQL** for storing LiDAR metadata and **cloud storage** for large LiDAR files.

### Implementation:
1. **LiDAR Data Integration**:  
   - Retrieve **LiDAR data** from sources like **NASA's GEDI mission** or commercial providers (e.g., **Airbus** or **Planet Labs**).
   - Process LiDAR data to extract **elevation models** and generate 3D representations of terrain and structures.

2. **3D Visualization**:  
   - Use **three.js** to create 3D models from LiDAR data, enabling users to rotate and explore terrains interactively.
   - Integrate **CesiumJS** for geospatial 3D rendering, enabling visualization of large-scale maps and topographies.

## 3. **AI-Powered Detection of Anomalies**
### Objective:
To use AI and machine learning (ML) for detecting anomalies in satellite imagery that could indicate archaeological sites.

### Plan:
- **Technology**:  
  - **Backend**: Java for API development, Python for ML model training.
  - **Machine Learning**: **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for training models to detect patterns in satellite imagery.
  - **Data**: Use **Google Earth Engine** and **Sentinel-2** imagery.
  - **Data Storage**: **PostgreSQL** to store model outputs and predictions.

### Implementation:
1. **AI Model Training**:  
   - Train a machine learning model using **labeled datasets** (images with known archaeological sites) to identify patterns in satellite images such as **rectangular shapes**, **straight lines**, or **irregularities**.
   - Use **transfer learning** with pre-trained models (like **ResNet** or **EfficientNet**) for faster training.

2. **Model Integration**:  
   - Deploy the model on the server using **TensorFlow Serving** or **PyTorch** to make predictions on incoming satellite images.
   - Use the model to flag potential archaeological anomalies and provide confidence scores for further investigation.

3. **Frontend**:  
   - Display flagged anomalies on the map with the ability to click and review predicted areas of interest.
   - Allow users to manually mark or confirm the accuracy of AI detections to improve the model over time.

## 4. **Collaboration and Crowdsourcing**
### Objective:
To enable collaborative exploration and crowdsourcing of insights on satellite imagery analysis.

### Plan:
- **Technology**:  
  - **Backend**: Java (Jakarta EE) to handle user collaboration features.
  - **Frontend**: React.js with **Firebase** for real-time updates.
  - **Database**: Use **MongoDB** for flexible storage of user data and collaboration activities.

### Implementation:
1. **User Authentication**:  
   - Implement user accounts and roles (researchers, archaeologists, and enthusiasts) using **Jakarta Security** and **OAuth2** for login.
   - Store user annotations and contributions in **MongoDB**, which will allow for flexible schema handling.

2. **Real-Time Collaboration**:  
   - Use **Firebase Realtime Database** to enable real-time annotations, comments, and collaborative exploration.
   - Allow users to interact with the satellite images, annotate areas, and add comments that others can view in real-time.

3. **Discussion Boards & Forums**:  
   - Integrate **Discourse API** or build custom discussion boards to facilitate communication and insights sharing.

## 5. **Time-Lapse and Historical Comparisons**
### Objective:
To enable users to compare satellite imagery over different periods, revealing changes in the landscape and potential patterns.

### Plan:
- **Technology**:  
  - **Frontend**: React.js for creating time-lapse comparisons.
  - **Backend**: Java (Jakarta EE) to serve historical satellite imagery.
  - **Data**: Use **Google Earth Engine** or **NASA's MODIS data** for accessing historical satellite imagery.

### Implementation:
1. **Image Collection**:  
   - Use **Google Earth Engine** to retrieve **historical satellite imagery** over specified regions.
   - Implement a filtering mechanism to allow users to select specific **time ranges** (e.g., past 5, 10, 50 years).

2. **Comparison Tools**:  
   - Allow users to overlay two images from different time periods.
   - Integrate **ImageMagick** or **OpenCV** for comparing images visually, highlighting changes and patterns in the landscape.

3. **Frontend**:  
   - Build an intuitive **slider** for users to view the change over time by sliding between two images.
   - Use **React.js** with custom components to smoothly transition between images.
