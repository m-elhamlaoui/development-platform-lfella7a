# Project Title: Lost City Explorer

## Project Overview:
**Lost City Explorer** is a web-based platform that utilizes **satellite imagery**, **remote sensing technologies**, and **data analytics** to help archaeologists and enthusiasts discover and explore **lost cities** and **ancient civilizations** that may have been hidden beneath dense forests, deserts, or other challenging terrains. The platform integrates a variety of satellite data sources, including **high-resolution optical imagery**, **thermal infrared imaging**, **LiDAR**, and **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)**, to uncover hidden features in the landscape that may point to the existence of ancient cities, structures, and urban systems.

By offering an intuitive user interface, **Lost City Explorer** enables users to analyze satellite imagery, detect potential archaeological sites, and prioritize areas for further investigation. The platform's goal is to provide a collaborative, crowd-sourced approach to satellite data interpretation, making the tools of modern archaeology more accessible and efficient for a global community of explorers.
