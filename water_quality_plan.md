# Water Quality Analysis Enhancement Plan

## Current System Overview
Our current water quality analysis system uses Sentinel-2 satellite data to provide:
- Water Coverage Detection (92.5%)
- Clear Water Analysis (96.8%)
- Moderate Quality Assessment (3.1%)
- Algal Presence Detection (0.1%)
- Cloud Handling Accuracy (85%)

## Planned AI/ML Enhancements

### 1. Random Forest Enhancement (Phase 1)
**Status**: In Progress (60% Complete)

- Incorporate multiple spectral bands
- Validate against current results

```python
Features:
- NDWI values
- RGB channels
- NIR band
- Additional spectral indices
- Cloud mask features
- Terrain information
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Reduced false positives in urban areas
- Better handling of shallow water
- More accurate water body delineation
- Improved cloud masking

### 2. Deep Learning Implementation (Phase 2)
**Status**: Planning Phase
**Objective**: Implement U-Net architecture for advanced segmentation
- Multi-class water quality segmentation
- End-to-end training pipeline
- Transfer learning from existing models
- GPU-accelerated processing

```python
Classes:
1. Clear Water
2. Moderate Quality Water
3. Algal Presence
4. Cloud Cover
5. Non-water
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- More precise boundary detection
- Better handling of mixed pixels
- Improved algal bloom detection
- Real-time processing capability

### 3. Temporal Analysis (Phase 3)
**Status**: Initial Planning
**Objective**: Track water quality changes over time
- LSTM-based prediction model
- Historical trend analysis
- Change detection system
- Anomaly detection

```python
Features:
- Water coverage trends
- Quality transitions
- Seasonal patterns
- Anomaly detection
- Weather correlation
- Climate impact analysis
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Early warning system for quality changes
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Future condition predictions
- Climate change impact assessment
